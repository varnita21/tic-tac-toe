# tic-tac-toe

#The main file is PlayTicTacToe and it has one test case included if you want to edit or create a new one you can do that by creating the object of Operations class.
Note. I've implemented to change the size of the grid in optional requirements but forgot to change the condition which tells the invalid input. If you allow me I can edit it and will commit the code.
